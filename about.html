                            <span class="kristi-regular">Hello there!</span> <br> I'm <span class="bolden">Nana Aba Ackah</span> originally from Ghana and now enjoying life in Canada.<br>
                            Let me tell you a bit about myself!<br>
                            I have a <span class="bolden">BA in Business and Computer Systems</span> from Trent University, which has laid the foundation for my diverse career.<br>
                            Currently, I'm an <span class="bolden">ERP Systems Developer and Research Administrator</span> at IN Engineering + Surveying Ltd.<br>
                            My role involves customizing and developing Odoo ERP systems to enhance business workflows, creating engaging WordPress websites, and driving digital marketing strategies that boost online presence.<br>
                            I'm also skilled in conducting meticulous title research and leveraging tools like Teranet for surveying projects.
                            <br><br>
                            I love integrating technology with business to solve complex problems and improve operational efficiency.<br>
                            My expertise spans Python programming, front-end development, and SEO, making me a versatile asset in any project.<br>
                            Whether it's spearheading innovative solutions, collaborating with cross-functional teams, or providing technical consultations, I'm passionate about making a significant impact.<br>
                            My journey has also taken me through roles such as a Digital Marketing Intern at Lala Skin Essentials, where I created impactful campaigns, and as the Director of Events at the Trent African and Caribbean Students Union, organizing culturally enriching events.<br>
                            I've also had hands-on experience with database management and technical assessments during my internship at MTN Ghana.<br><br>
                            With certifications in web development and Python for data science, my toolkit is ever-expanding.<br>
                            My passion lies at the intersection of technology and business, always aiming to enhance operational efficiency and drive meaningful digital transformations.<br>
                            Let's connect and explore how I can bring my expertise to your next exciting project!<br>
